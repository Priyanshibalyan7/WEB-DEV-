                    <h2>My First blog</h2>
                    <p>Pitter-patter goes the rain. The world outside transforms, washed in shades of grey and glistening green. There's a distinct sound to a rainy day—the rhythmic tapping on windowpanes, the soft rustling of leaves as water kisses them, and the distant rumble of thunder that adds a dramatic flair.<br><br>There’s a certain kind of peace that comes with it, a gentle hum that invites you to slow down. It’s the perfect excuse to curl up with a good book and a hot cup of cocoa, while the fresh scent of wet earth, known as petrichor, drifts in through the open window</p>
                    <h2>My second blog</h2>
                    <p>The celebrations usually span five days, with the main festivities occurring on the third day. Homes are thoroughly cleaned and decorated with colorful rangoli patterns, twinkling electric lights, and traditional earthen lamps called diyas. The glow from these lamps transforms every street and home into a mesmerizing sight, filling the night with a warm, festive ambiance.<br> <br>For many, the festival is a celebration of Lord Rama's return to Ayodhya after his 14-year exile and victory over the demon king Ravana. On the main day, families perform Lakshmi Puja, worshipping Goddess Lakshmi for wealth and prosperity, and Lord Ganesha for good fortune and wisdom. Dressed in new clothes, people exchange gifts and delicious sweets, sharing the festive joy with loved ones. </p>
